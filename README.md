# Costco Growth Playbook

As a lifelong Costco loyalist — and self-proclaimed chicken nugget enthusiast — this project was born from a mix of curiosity and passion.  
My all-time favorite Costco item? **Real Good chicken nuggets**. I’ve sampled nearly every nugget Costco has stocked over the years — from *Just Bare* (TikTok-famous for their Chick-fil-A flavor) to the occasional limited-edition batch. The *Real Good* ones win for their clean ingredients, high protein, and perfect crisp when air-fried at 400°F for 8 minutes.  

Costco’s nugget rotation is like a treasure hunt — you never quite know what’s in stock until you’re there. It’s this same thrill of discovery that inspired me to build the **Costco Growth Playbook** — a deep dive into how Costco can continue its upward trajectory, capture more member loyalty, and keep delighting fans like me who come for the groceries but stay for the small obsessions.

## 📈 STAR Method Mini-Stories  

**1️⃣ Membership Retention Strategy**  
- **Situation:** Costco’s renewal rates are industry-leading, but younger shoppers are slower to commit.  
- **Task:** Identify ways to convert trial memberships into long-term renewals.  
- **Action:** Built a retention dashboard in Lovable to track renewal behavior, segment members by age group, and model retention lift from targeted perks like digital-first coupons and seasonal product drops.  
- **Result:** Model projected a 4% lift in under-35 renewals — worth an estimated $78M in recurring annual revenue.  

**2️⃣ Private Label Expansion**  
- **Situation:** Kirkland Signature products are highly profitable but underpenetrated in certain categories.  
- **Task:** Pinpoint high-growth, low-competition product lines for expansion.  
- **Action:** Conducted SKU-level profitability analysis and competitor mapping, identifying ready-to-eat healthy frozen meals (including premium nuggets!) as an untapped growth lane.  
- **Result:** Forecast showed potential to capture $120M in incremental revenue in the first year of launch.  

**3️⃣ Operational Efficiency Wins**  
- **Situation:** Rising logistics costs were eating into margins.  
- **Task:** Recommend optimizations without compromising product freshness or availability.
